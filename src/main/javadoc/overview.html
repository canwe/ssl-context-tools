  <p>Convenient tools for configuring and creating SSLContext objects</p>
  <p>
    Custom SSL context objects are often needed when connecting to a server 
    that uses a self-signed SSL certificate or when SSL mutual authentication 
    is required. Creating an <code>SSLContext</code> requires many steps and 
    fairly extensive knowledge of the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) APIs.
    This library provides a convenient and easy to use 
    <code>SSLContextBuilder</code> that handles the most common cases of 
    SSL context configuration and creation.
